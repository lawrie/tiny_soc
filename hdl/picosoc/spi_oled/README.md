# SPI OLED Display

## The Display

The display used is a 128x128 pixel, 16-bit RGB SSD1351.

It uses an SPI connection with SCK, SDA (MOSI), RES, DC and CS connections.

# Operation

I am thinking of driving the display from software without any GPU support.

The hardware scrolling wil be used for platform games.
