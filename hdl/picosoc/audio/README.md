# TODO document the audio driver

# Current thoughts

- 3 channels
- each channel having:
 - square/triangle/saw/noise waveform generators
 - *possibly* wavetable support
 - ADSR envelope generator
 - ring modulation / sync
- (maybe) global filter (HP/LP/BP/Notch) available to route channels through
