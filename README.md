# Overview

The idea behind this project is to use PicoSoC (from Clifford Wolf), and add some verilog peripherals to make it suitable for writing simple games on the TinyFPGA BX..

The PicoRV CPU variant chosen will be, by necessity, very cut-down in functionality - along the lines of the "small" profile.  Unfortunately the larger profiles with support for things like multipliers/dividers would be impossible to fit into the space available on the ice40hx8k part.

The planned peripherals are:

* On-board LED
* GPIO inputs (buttons, switches)
* Serial UART
* [planned] an IRQ-based timer/counter
* [planned] a 3-channel audio synthesizer
* [planned] Graphics output
 * 320x240 resolution
 * palette of 16 colours from ~262k
 * tile/map based support
 * sprites
* [planned] game controller (e.g. Wii Nunchuk)

Planned IO locations for the devices are:

| MEM_ADDR (hex) | Peripheral |
| ---------- | ---------- |
| 0x0000_0000 -> 0x0000_0400 | SRAM |
| 0x0005_0000 -> 0x0010_0000 | SPI Flash (usable region) |
| 0x0005_0000 | reset vector (when the CPU is reset it starts executing code here) |
| 0x0005_0010 | IRQ vector (when an IRQ is triggered, CPU jumps here) |
| 0x0200_0000 | SPI config |
| 0x0200_0004 | UART divider |
| 0x0200_0008 | UART data register |
| 0x03xx_xxxx | On-board LED |
| 0x03xx_xxxx | GPIO buttons |
| 0x04xx_xxxx | Audio device |
| 0x05xx_xxxx | Video device |
| 0x06xx_xxxx | Timer/counter |
| 0x07xx_xxxx | Game controller |


Documentation for each of the peripherals, including more detailed register mappings will be placed in their respective folders under hdl/picosoc (as they are developed).
